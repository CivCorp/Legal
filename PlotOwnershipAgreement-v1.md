## Notice
Notice to the Plot Owner shall be delivered via the CivCorp Discord.

Notice to the Plot Manager shall be delivered via the CivCorp Discord.

## Ownership Rights

The Plot Owner has rights to the possession and use of the Premises, and may generally use the Premises in whichever way they see fit, within the limitations specified by this Agreement.

So long as the Plot Owner remains in Compliance, the Plot Owner and the Premises shall not be disturbed by the Plot Manager.

The Plot Owner is free to make improvements, additions, and alterations to the Premises.

The Plot Owner is free to lease or rent out any part of the Premises, but remains responsible for remaining in Compliance.

## Sale

So long as the Plot Owner remains in Compliance, the Plot Owner may sell the Plot at any time, to a Purchaser, by delivering Notice to the Plot Manager of the Purchaser and the Purchase Price.

The Purchaser must agree either to follow the Plot Ownership Agreement specified by the Plot Owner's Plot Purchase Agreement, or to follow the newest version of the Plot Ownership Agreement. The Plot Manager shall then create a Plot Purchase Agreement with the Purchaser for the Purchase Price. The Plot's Assessed Value will be set to the Purchase Price.

The Plot Owner and the Purchaser shall reach an agreement between themselves as to the condition of the Premises and ownership of any structures or possessions contained within the Premises at the time of sale. The Plot Manager does not involve themselves with any such agreements and is generally only concerned with maintaining records of the sale and ownership of the Plot.

## Restrictions

The Plot Owner may not create, or permit to be created, any Hazard within the Premises.

If a Hazard exists within the Premises, the Plot Manager shall be permitted to take the minimum actions necessary to remove the Hazard.

If a Hazard within the Premises causes damages to any person other than the Plot Owner, the Plot Owner shall be liable to the Plot Manager for an amount equal to the cost of settlement with the harmed person for said damages.

The Plot Owner may not create, or permit to be created, any Nuisance within the Premises.

The Plot Owner may not create, or permit to be created, any display of hate symbols or obscenities within the Premises.

The Plot Owner may not store, or permit to be stored, any Exile Pearl containing a prisoner within the Premises.

The Plot Owner may not violate, or permit to be violated, any rules of the CivRealms server within the Premises.

## Noncompliance

If the Plot Owner is found to be in Noncompliance, the Plot Manager may deliver Notice to the Plot Owner of the Noncompliance. The Notice must specify the actions the Plot Owner shall take in order to return to Compliance.

The Plot Owner shall have 7 days after delivery of the Notice of Noncompliance to return to Compliance.

If the Plot Owner fails to return to Compliance within 7 days of delivery of the Notice of Noncompliance, the Plot Manager may sieze the Plot from the Plot Owner. This is the only condition under which siezure may occur.

If siezure occurs, the Plot Owner's ownership of the Plot ends, ownership of the Plot returns to the Plot Manager, and the Plot Owner forfeits any rights to the Premises or to any structures or property contained within the Premises.

## Assessed Value

The Assessed Value shall be measured in Stamina.

The Assessed Value of the Plot shall initially be set to the Purchase Price specified by the Plot Purchase Agreement.

The Plot Manager may reassess the Plot at any time to update the Assessed Value of the Plot, but in doing so the Plot Manager must provide the Plot Owner with a Purchase Offer for an amount equal to the new Assessed Value.

When Notice of a Purchase Offer is delivered to the Plot Owner, the Plot Owner must then decide within 7 days to take one of two actions:
- Sell the Plot to the Plot Manager for an amount equal to the new Assessed Value
- Retain the Plot, agree to the new Assessed Value, and pay Dues on the new Assessed Value moving forward

If the Plot Owner chooses to sell the Plot to the Plot Manager, the Plot Owner must return the Premises to Good Condition within 7 days of delivery of the Notice. If the Premises cannot be returned to Good Condition within 7 days, the Plot Owner must either obtain a Good Condition Exception from the Plot Manager, or retain the Plot and agree to the new Assessed Value.

## Dues

The Plot Owner agrees to pay Dues to the Plot Manager by the end of each month, an amount of Stamina equal to the Dues Percentage of the Plot's Assessed Value as of the beginning of that month.

The Dues Percentage is 6.25%. The Dues Percentage may be decreased from time to time at the discretion of the Plot Manager via the publication of newer versions of the Plot Ownership Agreement, but the Dues Percentage shall never be increased.

Any increase to the Assessed Value of the Plot that may occur during the month shall not impact the calculation of Dues until the following month.

## Amendment and Versioning

The Plot Manager may, from time to time at their discretion, update the terms of the Plot Ownership Agreement by publishing a newer version of the Plot Ownership Agreement.

A Plot Owner with a Plot Purchase Agreement specifying a particular version of the Plot Ownership Agreement to be followed shall be entitled to continue to follow that version of the Plot Ownership Agreement for as long as they own the Plot, and shall not be required to follow any newer versions of the Plot Ownership Agreement that may be published.

A Plot Owner with a Plot Purchase Agreement specifying an older version of the Plot Ownership Agreement may elect at any time to update their Plot Purchase Agreement to follow the newest version of the Plot Ownership Agreement. To do so, the Plot Owner shall deliver Notice to the Plot Manager. The Plot Manager shall then update the Plot Purchase Agreement to specify the newer version of the Plot Ownership Agreement to be followed.

This agreement may not otherwise be amended in any way.
